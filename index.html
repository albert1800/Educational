                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge,
                behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.The ability to learn is possessed by humans,
                animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some
                learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and
                knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime,
                and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be
                retrieved.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
                executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.
                Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
                resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly
                referred to as coding).The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
                intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
                processing unit.
